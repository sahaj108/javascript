You are a creature of habit. Every week you buy 5 oranges. But orange prices keep changing!
1.	You want to declare a function that calculates the cost of buying 5 oranges.
2.	You then want to calculate the cost of the 5 all together.
3.	Write a function that does this called orangeCost().
4.	It should take a parameter that is the cost of an orange, and multiply it by 5.
5.	It should log the result of the multiplication to the console.
6.	Call the function where oranges each cost 5 dollars.

}
orangeCost(prompt("How much is the price for 1 orange this week?"))
